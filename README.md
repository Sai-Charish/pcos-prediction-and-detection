# Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Detectiion and Prediction 

## What is PCOS:
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age. It is one of the most common endocrine conditions and can impact menstrual cycles, fertility, metabolism, and overall health.

PCOS occurs when there is an imbalance in reproductive hormones. Normally, the ovaries release an egg each month during ovulation. In PCOS, ovulation may not occur regularly because hormone levels—especially androgens (often called male hormones)—are elevated. This hormonal imbalance interferes with the normal development and release of eggs.

The main features of PCOS include irregular or absent menstrual periods, signs of excess androgens such as acne or excessive facial and body hair, and polycystic ovaries visible on ultrasound (many small follicles in the ovaries). Not every woman with PCOS has all these symptoms.

A major underlying factor in many cases is insulin resistance. Insulin is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar. When the body becomes resistant to insulin, it produces more of it. High insulin levels can stimulate the ovaries to produce more androgens, which worsens symptoms and disrupts ovulation. Insulin resistance also increases the risk of type 2 diabetes.

Common symptoms of PCOS include:

Irregular, infrequent, or missed periods

Excess facial or body hair (hirsutism)

Acne or oily skin

Weight gain, especially around the abdomen

Thinning hair on the scalp

Difficulty becoming pregnant

PCOS is typically diagnosed using clinical evaluation and the Rotterdam criteria. A diagnosis is made if at least two of the following are present:

Irregular ovulation or menstrual cycles

Clinical or laboratory signs of high androgen levels

Polycystic appearance of ovaries on ultrasound

Although there is no permanent cure for PCOS, it can be effectively managed. Treatment depends on a woman’s symptoms and whether she is trying to conceive. Lifestyle changes are the first-line treatment. Regular exercise, weight management, and a balanced diet can significantly improve symptoms and regulate cycles. Even a small weight loss of 5–10% can make a meaningful difference.

Medications may include:

Birth control pills to regulate periods and reduce androgen levels

Metformin to improve insulin sensitivity

Anti-androgen medications for excessive hair growth

Fertility treatments if pregnancy is desired

If untreated, PCOS can increase the risk of long-term health problems such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and endometrial cancer.

In summary, PCOS is a hormonal and metabolic disorder that affects ovulation and overall health. While it is a lifelong condition, early diagnosis and proper management can significantly reduce symptoms and prevent complications.
